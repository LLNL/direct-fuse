		 *

		 * can be used to prime the file system inode cache with the
		 * interior nodes we'll want in the path-walk. Then, when
		 * looking up the last component, ready everything for the
		 * operations(s) to come. The file system driver knows it's
		 * the last lookup in the walk because it has the intent,
		 * again, but without the path.
		 *
		 * One special case; If we were asked to look up a single
		 * component, we treat it as the last component. The file
		 * system driver never sees the extra path argument. It should
		 * be noted that the driver always has the fully qualified
		 * path, on the target file system, available to it for any
		 * node it is looking up, including the last, via the base
		 * path node and it's ancestor chain.
